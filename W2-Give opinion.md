# People think that government should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles to solve environmental problems. Give your opinion.

### Introduction

Some individuals suggest that it is necessary for the government to increase the expense of fuel for mobile vehicles in order to address environmental issues. 

From my view, this idea hold merit, I disagree with this approach because increasing the price of petrol is not an effective solution to solve environment problems.

From my view, I partly/totally agree/disagree with this suggestion based on some reasons that provided in this essay.


### Brainstorm
#### Partly agree 
- Giảm phương tiện cá nhân sang phương tiện công cộng, hoặc là đi xe đạp hoặc đi bộ
- Chuyển sang xe điện, xe hybrid
- Tiết kiệm năng lượng, để phát triển 

#### Totally disagree
- Gây ra phản ứng trái chiều trong người dân, số lượng người sử dụng xe cộ giảm đi không đáng kể tại vì tính tiện dụng của phương tiện cá nhân là không thể thay thế, đi xe đạp xa thì quá mệt 
- Some urban/rural areas of developing countries → không có đủ điều kiện/cơ sở vật chất để có thể đáp ứng được tiền và những phương tiện công cộng khác → Tăng giá fuel thì không thật sự hiệu quả ở những nơi như thế này và chỉ tạo ra gánh nặng tài chính cho người dân.
- Tăng giá xăng mà tăng trong thời gian ngắn thì sao, 


### Body 1:

One of the main reasons which makes public transportation is not popular in some rural areas of developing countries is that they are not have enough condition to adapt it, meaning that their public commutation are more difficult. This will creates more pressure on the financial problems for local people.  

### Body 2:

Secondly, increasing fuel prices is not an effective way to reduce pollution. In fact that can create negative reactions in some local people. People may continue using their cars or bikes because they have no other option. Instead of making fuel more expensive, the government can focus on long-term solutions such as investing in clean energy vehicles and improving public transportation systems. Another method is raising local individual’s awareness by showing them how limited of energy sources, and the consequences of wasting energy.



### Conclusion

In conclusion, I reaffirm my conviction that raising fuel prices is not the best way to solve environmental issues because it is not an effective way and may lead to negative reactions in individuals. Government should focus on clean energy, better public transportation systems and public education to reduce pollution.

### By AI

Some people believe that increasing fuel prices is an effective solution to environmental problems. However, I partly disagree with this view, as I believe that this policy might not be practical for everyone and may create negative effects, especially for people in rural areas.

In many developing countries, public transportation is not well developed, particularly in remote or rural areas. People living in these regions often rely heavily on personal vehicles such as motorbikes or small cars due to the lack of public transport option. Raising fuel prices in such places would increase the financial burden on these individuals and reduce their mobility, which could negatively impact their daily lives.

Moreover, make fuel more expensive may not necessarily reduce pollution. Many people might continue using their vehicles out of necessity, as they have no other choice. Instead of raising fuel costs, government should invest in long-term and sustainable solutions. These include improving public transportation systems, encouraging the use of electric vehicles, and increasing public awareness of the importance of protecting the environment and saving energy.

In conclusion, although increasing fuel prices could help reduce emissions to some extent, I believe it is not the most effective or fair solution. A better approach would be to provide affordable and clean transportation alternatives and educate people about energy conservation and environmental protection.
