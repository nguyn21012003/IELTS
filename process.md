### The diagram details the process of producing olive oil. Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information below.

#### By Jeremy

The flow chart describes step-by-step approaches how olive oil is produced. 

Overall , it is clear that there are seven main steps in the process, commencing with harvesting olives and culminating with delivering the final products to the market.

The process begins when olives are picked manually by gardeners. Next, the olives are moved to a rinsing machine where they are washed thoroughly with cold water. Thank to a conveyor belt, the clean olives are subsequently transferred to a smashing machine to be smashed into an olive paste with olive stones being released as a by-product.

Afterwards, whereas the olive stones are discarded, the olive paste is packed into bag with holes. The products are then pressed by a pressing machine, before being separated into oil and water. While the excess water is eliminated, the oil is finally distributed to stores for storage, sales and consumption.

The diagram elucidated the sequential process involved in the the production of olive oil.

It is evident that the olive oil production process is comprised of sven distinct stages, begining whith the manual haresting of olives and concluding with the distribution of the final product to the market.

The initial step involves the meticulous manual harvesting of olives by skilled gardeners. Subsequently, the harvested olives are transferred to a rinsing machine, where they are thoroughly cleansed with cold water to remove impurities. Following this, the clean olives are conveyed via conveyor belt to a smashing machine, where they are effectively crush into a paste. It is noteworthy that this stage also results in the extraction of olive stones, which are classified as a by-product. 

In the following stage, the olive paste is placed into perforated bags to facilitate the separation of oli from water. The paste is then subjected to a pressing machine, where the oil is extracted while excess water is separated. Ultimately, the resulting olive oil is collected and prepared for distribution, ensureing that it reaches retailers for subsequent sale and consumer use.
