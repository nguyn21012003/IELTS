# Some people say it is the government's responsibility to transport children to school, while others believe parents should transport their children to school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

### Introduction

Some individuals claim that transporting children to school should be the responsibility of the government, while others suggest that their parents should take on this obligation. Although both views hold merit, I agree more with the former/later perspective. $\to$ Although both views hold merit, my view is that this responsibility should be mutually shared by both the government and parents.

- Khuyến khích hs đi học
- Tiết kiệm thời gian
- Đúng giờ hơn
- Tốt cho trẻ em ở xa
- Giảm gánh nặng
- Chính phủ lo thì tiết kiệm thời gian, tức là hiện tại nhưng đang rất phí thời gian

On the one hand, there are some benefits when the government can transport children to school. First of all, in some rural areas of developing nations, geographical constraints may limit access to education, resulting in a large number of children failing to go to school. If the government can intervene and provide free and universal transportation, these children could receive adequate education, helping them contribute positively to their nations in the future. Also, the concurrent time of parents going to work and children's traveling to school means that routes are not optimized, leading to congestion. When the government can transport children to school, parents can do/go directly to their workplace, limiting congestions and reducing waste.[^1]



One of the main reasons which makes traffic jam very severe in rush hours is that parents often take their children to school and then get to their workplace, meaning that their routes are longer and their vehicles would occupy the streets more. If the government can take care of children transportation, parents can focus on traveling to work, while children can be moved together in large vehicles. This would reduce traffic congestions, which saves a lot of time and money.

Nowadays, many children fail to get access to education due to geographical constraints(giới hạn địa lý), which may lead to a large population being uneducated and unsuitable for specialized jobs. As a result, these barriers could be removed, benefiting children who live in rural areas. 





#### Body 2: Giải thích tại sao parents nên nhận trách nhiệm này

- Thân với trẻ em ơn, tăng cường gánh kết gia đình
- Chính phủ bị quá tải

In order to satisfy the demand for travel of all children in a nation, the number of vehicles and the amount of human resources would be enormous, making financing such as plan unrealistic. If the government can manage the funding by diverting resources from other fields, it would create many issues as vital
