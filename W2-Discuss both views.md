# Some people think that sense of competition should be encouraged in children. However, others consider cooperation more important to make them good adults. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.

## Brainstorm

#### Introduction
It is commonly/widely argued that because of children should be encouraged to have sense of competition, while some individuals suggest that children should have cooperation. **Although both views hold merit, my view/I agree more with the former/later perspective**. $\to$ **Although both views hold merit, my view is that both dignity should be have in children**

#### Body 1: Giải thích nhận định 1

- Làm tốt công việc hơn, ham học tập hơn tại vì sao muốn tốt hơn đối thử.
- Nếu mà có được tính cạnh tranh từ bé -> Khi mà lớn lên thì nó quen với áp lực từ những việc có yếu tố cạnh tranh cao như là xin việc làm.
- Nó tạo ra một cái mục tiêu ảo -> Trẻ em sẽ cố gắng phấn đấu để được cái mục tiêu đó.


On the one hand, there are some benefits when children have sense of competition. Firstly, awareness of competition motivates children to improve themselves and reach higher standard. The children can learn multiple skills via a competition, such as creation and goal-setting skills. For example, those children take part in sport competitions or academic contests, children are motivated to train harder and improve their performance in order to win. This not only help them build their physical strength but also teaches them discipline and patience. Secondly, they can learn how to cope with pressure and handle comparative with others, which can be beneficial for their future academic and professional lives.


#### Body 2: Giải thích tại sao cooperation là quan trọng hơn

On the others hand, cooperative working is marvelously successful in helping kids to communicate effectively. Working separately can gain lot of individual achievements, but teamwork is the main reasons for the growth up of the society. To illustrate, if leaners cooperate with their friends in an educational environment, they will mutually trust, accept those who are different from themselves. Thus, it can be seen that cooperation is the thing that should be taught for today, being where competition leaves off.

##### Overall

In conclusion, I reaffirm my conviction that although there are some mixed opinions on determining whether the sense of competition or cooperation working should be considered, I think that both ability should share this responsibility. While working individually can help kids develop their personal skills, working in team which can help children trust others.

# Some people say it is the government's responsibility to transport children to school, while others believe parents should transport their children to school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

### Introduction

Some individuals claim that transporting children to school should be the responsibility of the government, while others suggest that their parents should take on this obligation. Although both views hold merit, I agree more with the former/later perspective. $\to$ Although both views hold merit, my view is that this responsibility should be mutually shared by both the government and parents.

#### Body 1: Giải thích tại sao the government nên chịu trách nhiệm đưa hs tới trường
- Khuyến khích hs đi học
- Tiết kiệm thời gian
- Đúng giờ hơn
- Tốt cho trẻ em ở xa
- Giảm gánh nặng
- Chính phủ lo thì tiết kiệm thời gian, tức là hiện tại nhưng đang rất phí thời gian

On the one hand, there are some benefits when the government can transport children to school. First of all, in some rural areas of developing nations, geographical constraints may limit access to education, resulting in a large number of children failing to go to school. If the government can intervene and provide free and universal transportation, these children could receive adequate education, helping them contribute positively to their nations in the future. Also, the concurrent time of parents going to work and children's traveling to school means that routes are not optimized, leading to congestion. When the government can transport children to school, parents can do/go directly to their workplace, limiting congestions and reducing waste.[^1]



One of the main reasons which makes traffic jam very severe in rush hours is that parents often take their children to school and then get to their workplace, meaning that their routes are longer and their vehicles would occupy the streets more. If the government can take care of children transportation, parents can focus on traveling to work, while children can be moved together in large vehicles. This would reduce traffic congestions, which saves a lot of time and money.

Nowadays, many children fail to get access to education due to geographical constraints(giới hạn địa lý), which may lead to a large population being uneducated and unsuitable for specialized jobs. As a result, these barriers could be removed, benefiting children who live in rural areas. 





#### Body 2: Giải thích tại sao parents nên nhận trách nhiệm này

- Thân với trẻ em ơn, tăng cường gánh kết gia đình
- Chính phủ bị quá tải

In order to satisfy the demand for travel of all children in a nation, the number of vehicles and the amount of human resources would be enormous, making financing such as plan unrealistic. If the government can manage the funding by diverting resources from other fields, it would create many issues as vital
