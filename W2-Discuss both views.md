## Brainstorm

#### Introduction
It is commonly/widely argued that because of children should be encouraged to have sense of competition, while some individuals suggest that children should have cooperation. **Although both views hold merit, my view/I agree more with the former/later perspective**. $\to$ **Although both views hold merit, my view is that both dignity should be have in children**

#### Body 1: Giải thích nhận định 1

- Làm tốt công việc hơn, ham học tập hơn tại vì sao muốn tốt hơn đối thử.
- Nếu mà có được tính cạnh tranh từ bé -> Khi mà lớn lên thì nó quen với áp lực từ những việc có yếu tố cạnh tranh cao như là xin việc làm.
- Nó tạo ra một cái mục tiêu ảo -> Trẻ em sẽ cố gắng phấn đấu để được cái mục tiêu đó.


On the one hand, there are some benefits when children have sense of competition. Firstly, awareness of competition motivates children to improve themselves and reach higher standard. The children can learn multiple skills via a competition, such as creation and goal-setting skills. For example, those children take part in sport competitions or academic contests, children are motivated to train harder and improve their performance in order to win. This not only help them build their physical strength but also teaches them discipline and patience. Secondly, they can learn how to cope with pressure and handle comparative with others, which can be beneficial for their future academic and professional lives.


#### Body 2: Giải thích tại sao cooperation là quan trọng hơn

On the others hand, cooperative working is marvelously successful in helping kids to communicate effectively. Working separately can gain lot of individual achievements, but teamwork is the main reasons for the growth up of the society. To illustrate, if leaners cooperate with their friends in an educational environment, they will mutually trust, accept those who are different from themselves. Thus, it can be seen that cooperation is the thing that should be taught for today, being where competition leaves off.

##### Overall

In conclusion, I reaffirm my conviction that although there are some mixed opinions on determining whether the sense of competition or cooperation working should be considered, I think that both ability should share this responsibility. While working individually can help kids develop their personal skills, working in team which can help children trust others.

# Some people say it is the government's responsibility to transport children to school, while others believe parents should transport their children to school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

### Introduction

Some individuals claim that transporting children to school should be the responsibility of the government, while others suggest that their parents should take on this obligation. Although both views hold merit, I agree more with the former/later perspective. $\to$ Although both views hold merit, my view is that this responsibility should be mutually shared by both the government and parents.

#### Body 1: Giải thích tại sao the government nên chịu trách nhiệm đưa hs tới trường
- Khuyến khích hs đi học
- Tiết kiệm thời gian
- Đúng giờ hơn
- Tốt cho trẻ em ở xa
- Giảm gánh nặng
- Chính phủ lo thì tiết kiệm thời gian, tức là hiện tại nhưng đang rất phí thời gian

On the one hand, there are some benefits when the government can transport children to school. First of all, in some rural areas of developing nations, geographical constraints may limit access to education, resulting in a large number of children failing to go to school. If the government can intervene and provide free and universal transportation, these children could receive adequate education, helping them contribute positively to their nations in the future. Also, the concurrent time of parents going to work and children's traveling to school means that routes are not optimized, leading to congestion. When the government can transport children to school, parents can do/go directly to their workplace, limiting congestions and reducing waste.[^1]



One of the main reasons which makes traffic jam very severe in rush hours is that parents often take their children to school and then get to their workplace, meaning that their routes are longer and their vehicles would occupy the streets more. If the government can take care of children transportation, parents can focus on traveling to work, while children can be moved together in large vehicles. This would reduce traffic congestions, which saves a lot of time and money.

Nowadays, many children fail to get access to education due to geographical constraints(giới hạn địa lý), which may lead to a large population being uneducated and unsuitable for specialized jobs. As a result, these barriers could be removed, benefiting children who live in rural areas. 





#### Body 2: Giải thích tại sao parents nên nhận trách nhiệm này

- Thân với trẻ em ơn, tăng cường gánh kết gia đình
- Chính phủ bị quá tải

In order to satisfy the demand for travel of all children in a nation, the number of vehicles and the amount of human resources would be enormous, making financing such as plan unrealistic. If the government can manage the funding by diverting resources from other fields, it would create many issues as vital

# Some people say that the increasing business and cultural contact between countries is positive development, while others think that many countries will lose their national identities as a result. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

### Introduction
Some individuals claim that the growing international business and cultural exchanges bring positive outcomes, while others suggest that may lead to the erosion of national identity. Although both hold merit, I agree more with the view that economic and cultural exchange should progress hand in hand with efforts to maintain each nation's unique identity.
Although both hold merit, I agree more with the former perspective.

### Body 1: Lý giải nhận định tại sao quan hệ kinh doanh và văn hoá is positive development

- Tăng cường xuất nhập khẩu
- Tăng cường quan hệ công chúng, tăng cường mối quan hệ giữa các nước với nhau
- Job creation.
- Nhiều khách du lịch

On the one hand, there are some benefits when the nations starting develop economic and cultural exchange. 

-- First of all, in some developing countries, considering cultural exchange can increase tourism, this not only increase their income in economic but also create job for urban employees and make the job market less competitive.

-- First of all, in some developing countries, visa policies constraints that limit travel or cultural exchange opportunities. If the government of each developed and developing nations could intervene and provide international transportation, this could help global connectivity. Also, the language barriers restrict individuals means that job market are not optimized, leading to congestion. If the government can encourage cross-cultural interaction, tourism, and economic collaboration on a broader scale.

On the other hand, opponents of the previous view claim that exchange economical and cultural can leave national identities behind. As far as I am concerned, this is an immature prejudice. It is the large amounts of cultural communication that allow us to compare our culture with others' cultures and gradually realize the peculiarities of our culture. For example, foreigner or international students can learn traditional through historic lessons or religious festivals. People associate this occasion with making fires, watching firework displays, and perhaps going to large events in local parks. Therefore, they gradually came to be aware of the characteristics of the culture and valued it more than ever before. Therefore, business and cultural contact will not weaken national identities, contrarily, they strengthen them.




### Overall

In conclusion, I reaffirm my conviction, national contact can not only drive the development of the economic but also improve the quality the job market. Therefore, we should persevere in globalization amid the siege of isolationism.


# Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

### Introduction

A number of individuals claim that the key of leading to successful in sport is physical strength, while others suggest that spirit strength is essential. Although both hold merit, I agree more with the view that these abilities should be mutually shared by athletes.

On the one hand, there are some benefits when athletes can focus on physical strength. First of all, in some sports, endurance constraints may limit access to take part in physical activities, resulting in a large of number athletes failing to have achievements. For instance, triathlon is a combination sport, included swimming, cycling and running. Athletes are relied a huge stamina in order to take part in this outdoor activity. If players do not have enough stamina, they may fail in this contest and even worse, they can harm themselves. Secondly, as long as athletes have advantages in physical strength, they also have more chance in winner than others. In basketball, short players have no chance to play again tall players, despite how they fast and mobility.

On the other hand, mentality is a tool that enhance performance, skills, maintain motivation and confidence of athletes. A strong mindset allows them to keep going even when they are tired or nearly to lose. Without mental strength, even talented players may lose confidence and perform poorly. In addition, having strong mentality can gain respect from other players and show a good sportsmanship. Thus, it can be seen that mentality should taught for young athletes for today.

In conclusion, I reaffirm my conviction that although there are some mixed opinion whether physical strength or mental strength should be considered, I think that both ability should be shared this responsibility. While a good physics can help participants avoid injuries and have some benefits in a game, mentality which can help athletes maintain their motivation and show a good sportsmanship.
