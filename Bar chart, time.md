Throughout the span of time, while the figure for male doctors decreased slowly to 62%, the percentage of female doctors rose slowly to about 40%. When it comes to where they were born, in the first year, the proportion of doctors who were born in Australia was more than 60%, which was twice as much as the figure for doctors born overseas.
